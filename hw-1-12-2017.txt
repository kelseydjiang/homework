Exercise 1: Absolute vs Relative Paths

Question - Starting from /Users/amanda/data/, which of the following commands could Amanda use to navigate to her home directory, which is...

Answer - 5, 7, 8, & 9 are all correct
5 and 8 would both navigate to the user's home directory, 9 goes back up one level at a time, and 7 is a more complex line of code to navigate to the home directory. 

Exercise 2: Relative Path Resolution

Question - Using the filesystem diagram below, if pwd dispalys /Users/thing, what will ls ../backup display?

Answer - 4. original, pnas_final, pnas_sub
The ls will display all the files in the backup folder.

Exercise 3: ls Reading Comprehension

Question - Assuming a directory structure as in the above Figure (File System for Challenge Questions), if pwd Displays /User/backup, and -r tells ls to display things in reverse order, what command will display:

Answer - 2 ls -r -F, 3 ls -r -F /Users/backup, & 4 Either #2 or #3 above, but not #1
2 is a generally display order while 3 is a more explicit command.

Exercise 4: Exploring More ls Arguments

Question - What does the command ls do when used with the -l and -h arguments?

Answer - -l stands for a long listing format and is an argument that lists a lot of information about the file within the folder, -h stand for "human readable" and is an argument that makes the information easy to read and puts information into layman terms.
